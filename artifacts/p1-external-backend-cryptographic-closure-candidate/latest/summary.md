# P1 External Backend Cryptographic Closure Candidate

This artifact composes the actual external nonce gate, real-threshold backend emission capture, standard-verifier evidence, and rejection comparison evidence for Batch 7.

- Status: `evidence_present_unclosed`
- Close candidate: `false`
- Claim boundary: `conformance/proof-review evidence only`
- Candidate digest SHA-256: `2deec67286073ab0970a5c9a7a5fa31d3b37fe8052d56a6581ce86f4a63e4b32`

Checks:
- `strict_external_nonce_capture_ready`: `true`
- `real_threshold_emission_present`: `false`
- `standard_verifier_acceptance_present`: `true`
- `mutation_rejection_complete`: `true`
- `rejection_distribution_comparison_present`: `true`
- `comparison_close_candidate`: `true`

Blockers:
- backend capture is quarantined from strict threshold-core closure
- centralized/single-seed smoke capture cannot satisfy real threshold emission
- backend capture lacks strict threshold core evidence: distributed_keygen_vss, partial_signing_over_secret_shares, partial_z_i_hint_aggregation, fips204_rejection_loop_over_threshold_partials
- real threshold backend emission capture is incomplete

This is not theorem closure. It does not prove Criterion 2, rejection-distribution preservation, selected-backend proof closure, production threshold ML-DSA security, CAVP/ACVTS validation, FIPS validation, or completed cryptographic proof.
